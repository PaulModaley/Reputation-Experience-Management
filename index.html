                    <p class="intro-text">Reputation Experience Management (RXM) combines the optimisation of Customer Experience (CX) with the management of a company’s Online Reputation (ORM).</br>

<br>Reputation Experience Management means obtaining customer feedback, responding to it, and acting on that feedback to improve the company’s services, optimise the Customer Experience and thus enhance the reputation of the brand. It includes not only the evaluation of self-gathered, structured data (e.g., from customer surveys), but also the unstructured “data in the wild” that people leave on the internet about your company — and is much more difficult to find and capture.<br></br> Only if you are able to listen, understand and act, can you set yourself apart from your competitors and be truly successful.

            <h3>Get Found</h3>
            <p style="font-size: medium; color:#efefef; margin-top: 20px;">To attract customers, you must be able to be found on the Internet. The basis for
                findability is a consistent online presence of your company. That’s because search
                engines such as Google compare all available data sources and display those
                results at the top of Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs).</br></br>
                As a result, you need to keep data up to date across all digital touchpoints — from
                your own website to business directories, social media and Google. Make sure that
                customers and prospects can find reliable information wherever they are. </p>

                <p style="font-size: medium; color:#efefef; margin-top: 10px;">Many consumers begin their search on Google. Therefore, it is a good idea for you
                    – or each of your locations – to appear directly in the Local Pack — the three most
                    relevant search results in the geographical vicinity of the searcher. To do this, you
                    need to claim and carefully maintain the Google My Business page associated with
                    your location. This page is your digital business card on Google, where customers
                    can leave feedback and learn more about you, including your location information.</p>

            <p style="font-size: medium; color:#004f5d; margin-top: 20px;">Reviews and ratings on Google, your website, and third-party sites influence

                <p style="font-size: medium; color:#004f5d; margin-top: 20px;">This is the only way to increase visibility and thus gain the interest of potential
                customers. What’s more, the feedback from your customers and prospects is
                valuable to you in three ways: In addition to visibility, you have the opportunity
                to positively influence the Customer Experience from the very beginning, for
                example by responding to queries via social media or Google reviews. </p>

                    from the various sources, you can find out areas of your company that
                    need improvement and the strengths/weaknesses of each of your
                    locations.</p>

                        to have a good Reputation Score and to have positive ratings on
                        the Internet. Above all, you have to do better than the competition.
                        Therefore, also look at how your competitors present themselves
                        online and deal with customer feedback.</p>
                <p style="background-color: #004f5d; color: #d7d7d7; margin-top: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 3px;"><strong style="color: #eaff59;">Consequences:</strong> : If you know what your customers complain about
                    and what they are happy about down to the location level, you will be
                    given initial starting points for improvement. You can use particular
                    locations as best practices from which the others can learn. Assign
                    the respective (especially time-critical crisis management) tasks to
                    the right people within your team. Initiate appropriate measures and
                    check whether these really lead to improvements.</p>

            <p>With a powerful RXM platform, you can efficiently analyze feedback and data
                from ratings, surveys and social media. Such a platform offers a clearly arranged
                dashboard that bundles and visualizes all data. In this way, you can see companywide and site-specific or regional operational areas where there is room for
                improvement. Such insights can be used for comprehensive optimisation
                measures – from supply chain management to employee training. </br></br> Schedule a demo to see how Reputation can enable your business to get found, get chosen, and get better</p>
