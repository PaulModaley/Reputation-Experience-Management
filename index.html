                    <p class="intro-text">Reputation Experience Management (RXM) combines the optimisation of Customer Experience (CX) with the management of a company’s Online Reputation (ORM).</br>

<br>Reputation Experience Management means obtaining customer feedback, responding to it, and acting on that feedback to improve the company’s services, optimise the Customer Experience and thus enhance the reputation of the brand. It includes not only the evaluation of self-gathered, structured data (e.g., from customer surveys), but also the unstructured “data in the wild” that people leave on the internet about your company — and is much more difficult to find and capture.<br></br> Only if you are able to listen, understand and act, can you set yourself apart from your competitors and be truly successful.</p>
