# What is Reputation Experience Management?

## Introduction

Welcome to my first project which is a business website outlining the concept of Reputation Experience Management (RXM) as unveiled by my employer, [Reputation](https://reputation.com/) (formerly reputation.com), at the end of 2020.

This microsite explains the concept of RXM - a merging of Online Reputation Management (ORM) and Customer Experience (CX) business practices that enable businesses to 'get found, get chosen, get better' and drive tangible business outcomes.

A live version of the website can be found [here](https://paulmodaley.github.io/Reputation-Experience-Management/).

## 1.UX

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

The reason for this website creation is to provide a more concise version of Reputation's 'RXM Guide: What is Reputation Experience Management?' - a document that currently exists in PDF format. 

A microsite format was selected for the revised RXM guide because of the potential SEO benefits of microsites to the company's main website. 

Furthermore, the marketing department at Reputation recognises the preference of our audience towards web based assets with longer, more contained pages as opposed to multi-page sites. These audience preferences have informed the design and development of this website.

<a name="goals"></a>
#### Project Goals

The goal of the website is to educate marketing and CX professionals about the RXM concept and to drive conversions in the form of a demo request. It will also serve as a useful point of reference for Reputation's sales team who can signpost prospective clients to the microsite. 

#### User Goals:

First time visitor goals:

<a name="expectations"></a>
#### User Expectations:

The content must:

- Offer an overview of RXM as a concept ('What is RXM?').

<a name="structure"></a>
#### Structure

The site will feature distinct sections - *header/intro section*, *Get Found*, *Get Chosen*, *Get Better*, *The Power of an RXM Platform/demo request section* -constituting a single page design. Users may navigate between the sections via the main navigation situated at the top of the page (right hand side in desktop mode). Users may return to the top of the page via the 'back to top' link found at the bottom of each section.

- Responsive on all devices sizes.
- Navigation bar changes to a 'hamburger' style menu (top centre of screen) on smaller screens
- Footer at the bottom of the page links to Reputation's website and social media pages.
- All elements will be comply with Reputation's branding, including colours, font size and typography.
<a name="skeleton"></a>
#### Skeleton

I generated designs for the website using wireframes in Balsamiq.

## 2. Features

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

**Single page design:**

- Navigation bar will be placed at the top of the screen to enable easy access for the user. It collapses to a hamburger-style menu on smaller screens and it employs a hover effect to enhance the user experience. As a sticky navigation bar, it will remain at the top of the screen as the user scrolls.
- The company logo will also feature at the top of the page.
- In the footer, users may access links to the company's main website as well as its numerous social media pages.

**Sections:**

The single page design is comprised of several distinct sections. Some of these sections (*) are accessible via the navigation bar. The sections are:

**<u>What is Reputation Experience Management?</u>**

This first section includes introductory text position to the right of a hero image situated in an angled div to add visual appeal to the page. This section is separated from the remained of the page by a div featuring the text, 'RXM Enables Brands To...' 

**<u>Get Found (*)**</u>

In the 'Get Found' section, users will be able to read about the importance of improving visibility online and how to make themselves more attractive to potential customers. 

There will be a video in this section that users can watch entitled, 'Introduction to Customer Reviews and Star Ratings'.

A 'back to the top' link will enable the user to return to the top navigation menu.

**<u>Get Chosen (*)</u>**

Distinguished from the previous section by its light grey background colour, 'Get Chosen' explains to users how customers choose businesses online.

A bar graph illustrates influences on the customer purchase decision. Such data provided in a visual way is appealing to Reputation customers.

**<u>Get Better (*)</u>**

A darker grey background distinguishes this section from 'Get Chosen'. Here, the user can read about how customer feedback can enable businesses to enhance the customer experience. 

Also, the '3Cs for the Optimal Customer Experience' will feature toward the bottom of this section in 3 darker coloured boxes which enhance the visual appeal of the page.

**<u>The Power of an RXM Platform (*)</u>**

In this section, users may view a video explaining the capabilities of the the Reputation platform. At the bottom of the section, there is a form which users may complete to signal their interest in receiving a demo of the platform.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

Technologies employed in the creation of the website are as follows:

- HTML5 
- CSS3
- JavaScript (for the mobile navigation menu)
- Chrome Developer Tools (for debugging and testing)
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=CjwKCAjwt8uGBhBAEiwAayu_9Re_SESOK5WbZcH6AhP1IRIE_hxODw8EmSBYSkPiRQ41fvAERHT38hoCClQQAvD_BwE) (for developing wireframes during the initial design process)

<a name="testing"></a>
### 4. Testing

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

**Google Developer Tools**

During the process of coding the website, I used Google Developer Tools to view the affects of changes to the code. Occasionally, I would alter the CSS within Google Developer Tools to observe changes before deciding whether or not to incorporate these changes within the code in GitPod. 

**Responsivity and Mobile-first Approach**

To ensure mobile responsivity, I made extensive use of Google Developer Tool's 'responsive' options, viewing my site on a range of devices, including iPhone 5/6/7/X.

**W3C Validator Tools**

Error identification and HTML validation was conducted using [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options) while [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) enabled me to identify errors within my project's CSS.

#### **Testing Process**

All sections of the page were tested thoroughly for mobile and web responsivity.

- Navigation bar:
  - On larger screens, the navigation displays on the right hand side as 4 distinct labels - *Get found, Get Chosen, Get Betters, Request a Demo*. A hover effect and a changing cursor adds interactivity.
  - On smaller screens, the navigation menu collapses into a hamburger style menu. When clicked, it produces a drop down menu showing the labels which navigate to each section. A hover effect and a changing cursor is employed to add visual appeal and to enhance the user experience.
  - The navigation bar directs users to the beginning of the distinct sections.
  - The navigation bar is 'sticky' meaning that it it stays visible at the top of the screen even as the user scrolls. This is to enable easy navigation of the page.
  - Users may return to the top of the page via a link reading 'back to top'. This features makes it easy for the user to navigate the page by eliminating the need for scrolling.
  - The navigation works as expected on both mobile and web.
- Page sections
  - Each section of the page features consistent fonts, font sizes and colour schemes that are not only consistent with the company's branding, but also enable easy-reading of the text.
  - Different types of content, including videos and bar graphs, are featured in different sections to add variety of content throughout the page and also to reinforce the messaging conveyed by the page.
  - A range of background colours have been used to demarcate each section.
  - All sections display as expected on mobile and web.
- Media
  - YouTube videos have been embedded within two of the sections.
  - CSS makes these videos responsive on different screen sizes.
  - All media functions correctly on mobile and web.
- Footer
  - The social icons in the footer open in a new tab when clicked.
  - They display well on both mobile and web.
  - The footer sections functions correctly on mobile and web.
- Button
  - The button opens a form in a new tab when clicked.
  - It functions correctly on mobile and web.

## 5. Development Cycle

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

Having established a clear vision for the project as illustrated through wireframes, the development cycle was fairly linear without a great deal of deviation from the original plan. 

However, there were a few changes made during the development cycle which were not accounted for during the planning process.  The changes were made following discussions with other developers who offered constructive criticism of the site during its development. 

#### Form

- A form was added to replace the 'Get a Demo Button'
- The form presents one major advantage over the 'Get a Demo' button - it reduces the number of clicks needed before the user can access the form and avoids the need for opening new tabs.

#### Navigation

- Following discussion with my mentor, I implemented a sticky navigation to enhance the user experience.

#### Shadows

- To enhance the visual appearance, I added a box shadow effect at the bar graphs and boxes including the form.

## 8. Known Bugs
<a name="knownbugs"></a>

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

- On desktop view in particular, the YouTube videos appear somewhat larger than would be ideal.
- Form inputs were not aligned. This has been remedied by adding a width of 100px to the CSS input 'label'.
